                        ButtGuard, the startup that literally “covers your dev’s ass” in code, announced today that it
                        has secured \$163 in seed funding from the Sunnyvale Nursing Home Residents’ Investment
                        Pool. The unexpected round was led by Sunnyvale’s Residents’ Club, with additional capital
                        contributed by Pleasant Meadows Memory Care and Golden Pines Retirement Community. The funds
                        will fuel ButtGuard’s expansion of its “Automated Asset Assurance” suite and support
                        integrations into a variety of popular development toolchains.

                        Building on four generations of behind-the-scenes patch-and-protect expertise (and several
                        lifetime supplies of adult diapers), ButtGuard founder and CEO Alex Ben responded to the growing
                        demand for foolproof code coverage. ButtGuard provides developers with a lightweight, AI-powered
                        “shield” around each code change—automatically generating unit tests, monitoring pull requests
                        for gaps, and even deploying emoji-stamped status updates to Slack channels when coverage dips
                        below 100%.
                    </p>
                    <p class="italic">
                        “I've always knew I was grandma's special little boy. When I needed to secure some funding, I knew just who to go to.
                        Thanks to our new partners at Sunnyvale, we can finally roll out our ‘Bottoms Up’ test-coverage
                        dashboard,” said Alex Ben, ButtGuard CEO. “Without adding headcount, engineering teams can now
                        rest easy knowing their backsides—and codebases—are fully protected.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="italic">
                        “We’re thrilled to back a startup that cares so much about… posterior protection,” said Margaret
                        Thompson, 92, President of the Sunnyvale Residents’ Club. “Our investment committee unanimously
                        agreed: if you’re going to invest retirement funds, you might as well have fun doing it. We
                        expect great returns—and great comfort.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The round comes on the heels of several successful pilot programs at local MSPs and indie
                        development shops, where ButtGuard’s signature Peach-Shield icon has already become a beloved
                        badge of honor. With the new capital, ButtGuard plans to hire additional “buttress engineers,”
                        accelerate its roadmap for memory-leak detection, and launch a limited-edition line of
                        company-branded adult onesies.
